Do with it as you may, but please include a link back to this github repository, so I get to see what cool/dumb stuff was made with it.\r\n\r\nIf you make something cool/dumb with it, that'd be good too. If you improve it, send a pull request and I can add your work, so you can get glory, girls and lots and lots of spam.\r\n\r\nHail Eris.","tagline":"A PHP OOP Discordian Calendar","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
